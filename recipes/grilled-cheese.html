        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I came up with this mozzarella grilled cheese recipe for my niece. 
            <br>
            I combined grilled cheese sandwiches with garlic bread. 
            <br>
            It's tasty, quick, and the perfect appetizer for friends, family, and unexpected guests. 
            <br>
            <strong>Use a firm white bread for best results.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder (Optional)</li>
            <li>12 slices white bread</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar vodka marinara sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven broiler.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place 6 slices of bread onto a baking sheet.
                <br>
                Spread a small handful of mozzarella cheese over each slice. 
                <br>
                Top with remaining 6 slices of bread.</li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Mix together butter and garlic powder in a small bowl; 
                <br>
                brush some garlic butter over tops of sandwiches or spread with the back of a spoon. 
                <br>
                Sprinkle with dried oregano.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place sandwiches under the broiler until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the sheet from the oven, flip sandwiches, 
                <br>
                brush tops with garlic butter, and sprinkle with oregano. Return to the broiler; cook until tops are golden brown, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut sandwiches in half diagonally; serve immediately with vodka sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
